# Meraki API Python Scripts

## Description:
Personal repository for some scripts I use to manage devices in the Meraki Cloud. I'm by no means a Python programmer. These meet the needs for the work I do. Feel free to use my scripts as you wish. If you find things to make them better, please send me a pull request. 

##### client-usage-info.py:

Used to go through my entire organization, to get client data usage for all locations. Once all the data is pulled, it will output it to a CSV.
